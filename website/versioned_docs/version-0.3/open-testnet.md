The IoTeX Testnet is now fully open for community and developers! Join our Testnet and interact with IoTeX network today!

## Set up the node
Our complete software is packaged in the form of a docker image plus a config file for the convenience of set-up and deployment. You can easily set up and run a node by following instructions at https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-testnet.

As of now, your node will be join as a fullnode to IoTeX network. Once we open the staking/voting on the testnet, you could promote your fullnode to a delegate and participate in block production. Expect that in the next few weeks.
